For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability

# ASN1.js

ASN.1 DER Encoder/Decoder and DSL.

## Example

Define model:

```javascript
var asn = require('asn1.js');

var Human = asn.define('Human', function() {
  this.seq().obj(
    this.key('firstName').octstr(),
    this.key('lastName').octstr(),
    this.key('age').int(),
    this.key('gender').enum({ 0: 'male', 1: 'female' }),
    this.key('bio').seqof(Bio)
  );
});

var Bio = asn.define('Bio', function() {
  this.seq().obj(
    this.key('time').gentime(),
    this.key('description').octstr()
  );
});
```

Encode data:

```javascript
var output = Human.encode({
  firstName: 'Thomas',
  lastName: 'Anderson',
  age: 28,
  gender: 'male',
  bio: [
    {
      time: +new Date('31 March 1999'),
      description: 'freedom of mind'
    }
  ]
}, 'der');
```

Decode data:

```javascript
var human = Human.decode(output, 'der');
(human);
/*
{ firstName: <Buffer 54 68 6f 6d 61 73>,
  lastName: <Buffer 41 6e 64 65 72 73 6f 6e>,
  age: 28,
  gender: 'male',
  bio:
   [ { time: 922820400000,
       description: <Buffer 66 72 65 65 64 6f 6d 20 6f 66 20 6d 69 6e 64> } ] }
*/
```

### Partial decode

Its possible to parse data without stopping on first error. In order to do it,
you should call:

```javascript
var human = Human.decode(output, 'der', { partial: true });
console.log(human);
/*
{ result: { ... },
  errors: [ ... ] }
*/
```

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - assert-plus@1.0.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# assert-plus

This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two
things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable
NODE\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like
`assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks
like this:

```javascript
    var assert = require('assert-plus');

    function fooAccount(options, callback) {
        assert.object(options, 'options');
        assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');
        assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');
        assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');
        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');
        assert.func(callback, 'callback');

        // Do stuff
        callback(null, {});
    }
```

# API

All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to
take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`
will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:

    AssertionError: foo (string) is required
    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)
    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)
    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)
    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)
    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)
    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)
    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)

from:

```javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.string(foo, 'foo');
    }
```

There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:

```javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');
    }
```

You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):

```javascript
    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');
```

Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the
environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have
lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in
production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are
also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from
the `assert` module avoids this behavior.

The complete list of APIs is:

* assert.array
* assert.bool
* assert.buffer
* assert.func
* assert.number
* assert.finite
* assert.object
* assert.string
* assert.stream
* assert.date

# async-each

No-bullshit, ultra-simple, 35-lines-of-code async parallel forEach function for JavaScript.

We don't need junky 30K async libs. Really.

For browsers and node.js.

## Installation
* Just include async-each before your scripts.
* `npm install async-each` if youâre using node.js.

## Usage

* `each(array, iterator, callback);` â `Array`, `Function`, `(optional) Function`
* `iterator(item, next)` receives current item and a callback that will mark the item as done. `next` callback receives optional `error, transformedItem` arguments.
* `callback(error, transformedArray)` optionally receives first error and transformed result `Array`.

```javascript
var each = require('async-each');
each(['a.js', 'b.js', 'c.js'], fs.readFile, function(error, contents) {
  if (error) console.error(error);
  console.log('Contents for a, b and c:', contents);
});

// Alternatively in browser:
asyncEach(list, fn, callback);
```

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 - bn.js@4.11.8

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# <img src="./logo.png" alt="bn.js" width="160" height="160" />

> BigNum in pure javascript

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js)

## Install
`npm install --save bn.js`

## Usage

```js
const BN = require('bn.js');

var a = new BN('dead', 16);
var b = new BN('101010', 2);

var res = a.add(b);
console.log(res.toString(10));  // 57047
```

**Note**: decimals are not supported in this library.

## Notation

### Prefixes

There are several prefixes to instructions that affect the way the work. Here
is the list of them in the order of appearance in the function name:

* `i` - perform operation in-place, storing the result in the host object (on
  which the method was invoked). Might be used to avoid number allocation costs
* `u` - unsigned, ignore the sign of operands when performing operation, or
  always return positive value. Second case applies to reduction operations
  like `mod()`. In such cases if the result will be negative - modulo will be
  added to the result to make it positive

### Postfixes

The only available postfix at the moment is:

* `n` - which means that the argument of the function must be a plain JavaScript
  Number. Decimals are not supported.

### Examples

* `a.iadd(b)` - perform addition on `a` and `b`, storing the result in `a`
* `a.umod(b)` - reduce `a` modulo `b`, returning positive value
* `a.iushln(13)` - shift bits of `a` left by 13

## Instructions

Prefixes/postfixes are put in parens at the of the line. `endian` - could be
either `le` (little-endian) or `be` (big-endian).

### Utilities

* `a.clone()` - clone number
* `a.toString(base, length)` - convert to base-string and pad with zeroes
* `a.toNumber()` - convert to Javascript Number (limited to 53 bits)
* `a.toJSON()` - convert to JSON compatible hex string (alias of `toString(16)`)
* `a.toArray(endian, length)` - convert to byte `Array`, and optionally zero
  pad to length, throwing if already exceeding
* `a.toArrayLike(type, endian, length)` - convert to an instance of `type`,
  which must behave like an `Array`
* `a.toBuffer(endian, length)` - convert to Node.js Buffer (if available). For
  compatibility with browserify and similar tools, use this instead:
  `a.toArrayLike(Buffer, endian, length)`
* `a.bitLength()` - get number of bits occupied
* `a.zeroBits()` - return number of less-significant consequent zero bits
  (example: `1010000` has 4 zero bits)
* `a.byteLength()` - return number of bytes occupied
* `a.isNeg()` - true if the number is negative
* `a.isEven()` - no comments
* `a.isOdd()` - no comments
* `a.isZero()` - no comments
* `a.cmp(b)` - compare numbers and return `-1` (a `<` b), `0` (a `==` b), or `1` (a `>` b)
  depending on the comparison result (`ucmp`, `cmpn`)
* `a.lt(b)` - `a` less than `b` (`n`)
* `a.lte(b)` - `a` less than or equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.gt(b)` - `a` greater than `b` (`n`)
* `a.gte(b)` - `a` greater than or equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.eq(b)` - `a` equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.toTwos(width)` - convert to two's complement representation, where `width` is bit width
* `a.fromTwos(width)` - convert from two's complement representation, where `width` is the bit width
* `BN.isBN(object)` - returns true if the supplied `object` is a BN.js instance

### Arithmetics

* `a.neg()` - negate sign (`i`)
* `a.abs()` - absolute value (`i`)
* `a.add(b)` - addition (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.sub(b)` - subtraction (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.mul(b)` - multiply (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.sqr()` - square (`i`)
* `a.pow(b)` - raise `a` to the power of `b`
* `a.div(b)` - divide (`divn`, `idivn`)
* `a.mod(b)` - reduct (`u`, `n`) (but no `umodn`)
* `a.divRound(b)` - rounded division

### Bit operations

* `a.or(b)` - or (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.and(b)` - and (`i`, `u`, `iu`, `andln`) (NOTE: `andln` is going to be replaced
  with `andn` in future)
* `a.xor(b)` - xor (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.setn(b)` - set specified bit to `1`
* `a.shln(b)` - shift left (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.shrn(b)` - shift right (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.testn(b)` - test if specified bit is set
* `a.maskn(b)` - clear bits with indexes higher or equal to `b` (`i`)
* `a.bincn(b)` - add `1 << b` to the number
* `a.notn(w)` - not (for the width specified by `w`) (`i`)

### Reduction

* `a.gcd(b)` - GCD
* `a.egcd(b)` - Extended GCD results (`{ a: ..., b: ..., gcd: ... }`)
* `a.invm(b)` - inverse `a` modulo `b`

## Fast reduction

When doing lots of reductions using the same modulo, it might be beneficial to
use some tricks: like [Montgomery multiplication][0], or using special algorithm
for [Mersenne Prime][1].

### Reduction context

To enable this tricks one should create a reduction context:

```js
var red = BN.red(num);
```
where `num` is just a BN instance.

Or:

```js
var red = BN.red(primeName);
```

Where `primeName` is either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:

* `'k256'`
* `'p224'`
* `'p192'`
* `'p25519'`

Or:

```js
var red = BN.mont(num);
```

To reduce numbers with [Montgomery trick][0]. `.mont()` is generally faster than
`.red(num)`, but slower than `BN.red(primeName)`.

### Converting numbers

Before performing anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted
to it. Usually, this means that one should:

* Convert inputs to reducted ones
* Operate on them in reduction context
* Convert outputs back from the reduction context

Here is how one may convert numbers to `red`:

```js
var redA = a.toRed(red);
```
Where `red` is a reduction context created using instructions above

Here is how to convert them back:

```js
var a = redA.fromRed();
```

### Red instructions

Most of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their
counterparts in red context:

* `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)`
* `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)`
* `a.redShl(num)`
* `a.redMul(b)`, `a.redIMul(b)`
* `a.redSqr()`, `a.redISqr()`
* `a.redSqrt()` - square root modulo reduction context's prime
* `a.redInvm()` - modular inverse of the number
* `a.redNeg()`
* `a.redPow(b)` - modular exponentiation

either `le` (little-endian) or `be` (big-endian).

### Utilities

* `a.clone()` - clone number
* `a.toString(base, length)` - convert to base-string and pad with zeroes
* `a.toNumber()` - convert to Javascript Number (limited to 53 bits)
* `a.toJSON()` - convert to JSON compatible hex string (alias of `toString(16)`)
* `a.toArray(endian, length)` - convert to byte `Array`, and optionally zero
  pad to length, throwing if already exceeding
* `a.toArrayLike(type, endian, length)` - convert to an instance of `type`,
  which must behave like an `Array`
* `a.toBuffer(endian, length)` - convert to Node.js Buffer (if available). For
  compatibility with browserify and similar tools, use this instead:
  `a.toArrayLike(Buffer, endian, length)`
* `a.bitLength()` - get number of bits occupied
* `a.zeroBits()` - return number of less-significant consequent zero bits
  (example: `1010000` has 4 zero bits)
* `a.byteLength()` - return number of bytes occupied
* `a.isNeg()` - true if the number is negative
* `a.isEven()` - no comments
* `a.isOdd()` - no comments
* `a.isZero()` - no comments
* `a.cmp(b)` - compare numbers and return `-1` (a `<` b), `0` (a `==` b), or `1` (a `>` b)
  depending on the comparison result (`ucmp`, `cmpn`)
* `a.lt(b)` - `a` less than `b` (`n`)
* `a.lte(b)` - `a` less than or equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.gt(b)` - `a` greater than `b` (`n`)
* `a.gte(b)` - `a` greater than or equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.eq(b)` - `a` equals `b` (`n`)
* `a.toTwos(width)` - convert to two's complement representation, where `width` is bit width
* `a.fromTwos(width)` - convert from two's complement representation, where `width` is the bit width
* `BN.isBN(object)` - returns true if the supplied `object` is a BN.js instance
* `BN.max(a, b)` - return `a` if `a` bigger than `b`
* `BN.min(a, b)` - return `a` if `a` less than `b`

### Arithmetics

* `a.neg()` - negate sign (`i`)
* `a.abs()` - absolute value (`i`)
* `a.add(b)` - addition (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.sub(b)` - subtraction (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.mul(b)` - multiply (`i`, `n`, `in`)
* `a.sqr()` - square (`i`)
* `a.pow(b)` - raise `a` to the power of `b`
* `a.div(b)` - divide (`divn`, `idivn`)
* `a.mod(b)` - reduct (`u`, `n`) (but no `umodn`)
* `a.divRound(b)` - rounded division

### Bit operations

* `a.or(b)` - or (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.and(b)` - and (`i`, `u`, `iu`, `andln`) (NOTE: `andln` is going to be replaced
  with `andn` in future)
* `a.xor(b)` - xor (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.setn(b)` - set specified bit to `1`
* `a.shln(b)` - shift left (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.shrn(b)` - shift right (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
* `a.testn(b)` - test if specified bit is set
* `a.maskn(b)` - clear bits with indexes higher or equal to `b` (`i`)
* `a.bincn(b)` - add `1 << b` to the number
* `a.notn(w)` - not (for the width specified by `w`) (`i`)

### Reduction

* `a.gcd(b)` - GCD
* `a.egcd(b)` - Extended GCD results (`{ a: ..., b: ..., gcd: ... }`)
* `a.invm(b)` - inverse `a` modulo `b`

## Fast reduction

When doing lots of reductions using the same modulo, it might be beneficial to
use some tricks: like [Montgomery multiplication][0], or using special algorithm
for [Mersenne Prime][1].

### Reduction context

To enable this tricks one should create a reduction context:

```js
var red = BN.red(num);
```
where `num` is just a BN instance.

Or:

```js
var red = BN.red(primeName);
```

Where `primeName` is either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:

* `'k256'`
* `'p224'`
* `'p192'`
* `'p25519'`

Or:

```js
var red = BN.mont(num);
```

To reduce numbers with [Montgomery trick][0]. `.mont()` is generally faster than
`.red(num)`, but slower than `BN.red(primeName)`.

### Converting numbers

Before performing anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted
to it. Usually, this means that one should:

* Convert inputs to reducted ones
* Operate on them in reduction context
* Convert outputs back from the reduction context

Here is how one may convert numbers to `red`:

```js
var redA = a.toRed(red);
```
Where `red` is a reduction context created using instructions above

Here is how to convert them back:

```js
var a = redA.fromRed();
```

### Red instructions

Most of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their
counterparts in red context:

* `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)`
* `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)`
* `a.redShl(num)`
* `a.redMul(b)`, `a.redIMul(b)`
* `a.redSqr()`, `a.redISqr()`
* `a.redSqrt()` - square root modulo reduction context's prime
* `a.redInvm()` - modular inverse of the number
* `a.redNeg()`
* `a.redPow(b)` - modular exponentiation

### Number Size

Optimized for elliptic curves that work with 256-bit numbers.
There is no limitation on the size of the numbers.

# BSER Binary Serialization

BSER is a binary serialization scheme that can be used as an alternative to JSON.
BSER uses a framed encoding that makes it simpler to use to stream a sequence of
encoded values.

It is intended to be used for local-IPC only and strings are represented as binary
with no specific encoding; this matches the convention employed by most operating
system filename storage.

For more details about the serialization scheme see
[Watchman's docs](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/bser.html).

## API

```js
var bser = require('bser');
```

### bser.loadFromBuffer

The is the synchronous decoder; given an input string or buffer,
decodes a single value and returns it.  Throws an error if the
input is invalid.

```js
var obj = bser.loadFromBuffer(buf);
```

### bser.dumpToBuffer

Synchronously encodes a value as BSER.

```js
var encoded = bser.dumpToBuffer(['hello']);
console.log(bser.loadFromBuffer(encoded)); // ['hello']
```

### BunserBuf

The asynchronous decoder API is implemented in the BunserBuf object.
You may incrementally append data to this object and it will emit the
decoded values via its `value` event.

```js
var bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();

bunser.on('value', function(obj) {
  console.log(obj);
});
```

Then in your socket `data` event:

```js
bunser.append(buf);
```

## Example

Read BSER from socket:

```js
var bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();

bunser.on('value', function(obj) {
  console.log('data from socket', obj);
});

var socket = net.connect('/socket');

socket.on('data', function(buf) {
  bunser.append(buf);
});
```

Write BSER to socket:

```js
socket.write(bser.dumpToBuffer(obj));
```

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# capture-exit

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/8044m918rwic8b9n/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/embercli/capture-exit/branch/master)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ember-cli/capture-exit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ember-cli/capture-exit)

Allow cooprative async exit handlers, we unfortunately must hijack
process.exit.

It allows a handler to ensure exit, without that exit handler impeding other
similar handlers

for example, see: [sindresorhus/ora#27](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ora/issues/27)

Differences between `process.on('exit')` and `captureExit.onExit(...)` => https://github.com/ember-cli/capture-exit/issues/12


### Installation

```sh
yarn add capture-exit
// or
npm install --save capture-exit
```

### Usage

```js
// as early in startup as possible
require('capture-exit').captureExit();

// when you want to schedule some work on exit:
function onExit() {
  return something.processWillExit(); // you can return promises, which will pause exit until fulfilled
}

require('capture-exit').onExit(onExit); // add an exit handler
require('capture-exit').offExit(onExit); // allows one to remove an exit handle if it is not longer required
```

> A neat wrapper around node.js fs.watch / fs.watchFile / FSEvents.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar)

## Why?
Node.js `fs.watch`:

* Doesn't report filenames on MacOS.
* Doesn't report events at all when using editors like Sublime on MacOS.
* Often reports events twice.
* Emits most changes as `rename`.
* Has [a lot of other issues](https://github.com/nodejs/node/search?q=fs.watch&type=Issues)
* Does not provide an easy way to recursively watch file trees.

Node.js `fs.watchFile`:

* Almost as bad at event handling.
* Also does not provide any recursive watching.
* Results in high CPU utilization.

Chokidar resolves these problems.

Initially made for **[Brunch](http://brunch.io)** (an ultra-swift web app build tool), it is now used in
[gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/),
[karma](http://karma-runner.github.io),
[PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/PM2),
[browserify](http://browserify.org/),
[webpack](http://webpack.github.io/),
[BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/),
[Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode),
and [many others](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/depended/chokidar/).
It has proven itself in production environments.

## How?
Chokidar does still rely on the Node.js core `fs` module, but when using
`fs.watch` and `fs.watchFile` for watching, it normalizes the events it
receives, often checking for truth by getting file stats and/or dir contents.

On MacOS, chokidar by default uses a native extension exposing the Darwin
`FSEvents` API. This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with
implementations like `kqueue` available on most \*nix platforms. Chokidar still
does have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.

On other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which
avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate
watchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been
specified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much
more than needed.

## Getting started
Install with npm:

```sh
npm install chokidar
```

Then `require` and use it in your code:

```javascript
var chokidar = require('chokidar');

// One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles
chokidar.watch('.', {ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../}).on('all', (event, path) => {
  console.log(event, path);
});
```

```javascript
// Example of a more typical implementation structure:

// Initialize watcher.
var watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {
  ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../,
  persistent: true
});

// Something to use when events are received.
var log = console.log.bind(console);
// Add event listeners.
watcher
  .on('add', path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))
  .on('change', path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))
  .on('unlink', path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));

// More possible events.
watcher
  .on('addDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))
  .on('unlinkDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))
  .on('error', error => log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))
  .on('ready', () => log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes'))
  .on('raw', (event, path, details) => {
    log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);
  });

// 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second
// argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats
watcher.on('change', (path, stats) => {
  if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`);
});

// Watch new files.
watcher.add('new-file');
watcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);

// Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem
var watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();

// Un-watch some files.
watcher.unwatch('new-file*');

// Stop watching.
watcher.close();

// Full list of options. See below for descriptions. (do not use this example)
chokidar.watch('file', {
  persistent: true,

  ignored: '*.txt',
  ignoreInitial: false,
  followSymlinks: true,
  cwd: '.',
  disableGlobbing: false,

  usePolling: true,
  interval: 100,
  binaryInterval: 300,
  alwaysStat: false,
  depth: 99,
  awaitWriteFinish: {
    stabilityThreshold: 2000,
    pollInterval: 100
  },

  ignorePermissionErrors: false,
  atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100)
});

```

## API

`chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`

* `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched
recursively, or glob patterns.
* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:

#### Persistence

* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process
should continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to
`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted
after `ready`, even if the process continues to run.

#### Path filtering

* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)
Defines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is
tested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it
gets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second
time with two arguments (the path and the
[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
object of that path).
* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while
instantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).
* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the
symlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following
the link references and bubbling events through the link's path.
* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be
derived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.
* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as
literal path names, even if they look like globs.

#### Performance

* `usePolling` (default: `false`).
Whether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling
leads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is
typically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over
a network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other
non-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on MacOS overrides the
`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable
to true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.
* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)
  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also
    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.
  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system
  polling for binary files.
  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))
* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on MacOS). Whether to use the
`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly
and `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When
set to `false` on MacOS, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.
* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the
[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
object that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set
this to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't
already available from the underlying watch events.
* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of
subdirectories will be traversed.
* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).
By default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before
the entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`
events will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,
especially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the
write operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.
Setting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,
holding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a
configurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily
dependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should
be relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.
Use with caution.
  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust
  timing params:*
  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in
  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.
  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.

#### Errors
* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files
that don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`
or `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.
* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).
Automatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use
"atomic writes" instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is
re-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event
rather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well
for you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in
milliseconds.

### Methods & Events

`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:

* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.
Available events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,
`raw`, `error`.
Additionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event
name and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.
* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.
* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file
system being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the
directories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the
values are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.

## CLI

If you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out
[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to
execute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.

## Install Troubleshooting

* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`
  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is
    not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,
    Chokidar should function properly.

* `ERR! stack Error: Python executable "python" is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`
  * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:
    `npm config set python python2.7`

* `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`
  * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - delegate@3.2.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# delegate

Lightweight event delegation.

## Install

You can get it on npm.

```
npm install delegate --save
```

If you're not into package management, just [download a ZIP](https://github.com/zenorocha/delegate/archive/master.zip) file.

## Setup

###### Node (Browserify)

```js
var delegate = require('delegate');
```

###### Browser (Standalone)

```html
<script src="dist/delegate.js"></script>
```

## Usage

### Add event delegation

#### With the default base (`document`)

```js
delegate('.btn', 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e.delegateTarget);
}, false);
```

#### With an element as base

```js
delegate(document.body, '.btn', 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e.delegateTarget);
}, false);
```

#### With a selector (of existing elements) as base

```js
delegate('.container', '.btn', 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e.delegateTarget);
}, false);
```

#### With an array/array-like of elements as base

```js
delegate(document.querySelectorAll('.container'), '.btn', 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e.delegateTarget);
}, false);
```

### Remove event delegation

#### With a single base element (default or specified)

```js
var delegation = delegate(document.body, '.btn', 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e.delegateTarget);
}, false);

delegation.destroy();
```

#### With multiple elements (via selector or array)

Note: selectors are always treated as multiple elements, even if one or none are matched. `delegate()` will return an array.

```js
var delegations = delegate('.container', '.btn', 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e.delegateTarget);
}, false);

delegations.forEach(function (delegation) {
    delegation.destroy();
});
```

Fast elliptic-curve cryptography in a plain javascript implementation.

NOTE: Please take a look at http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ before choosing a curve
for your cryptography operations.

## Incentive

ECC is much slower than regular RSA cryptography, the JS implementations are
even more slower.

## API

### ECDSA

```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;

// Create and initialize EC context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EC('secp256k1');

// Generate keys
var key = ec.genKeyPair();

// Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string)
var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msgHash);

// Export DER encoded signature in Array
var derSign = signature.toDER();

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, derSign));

// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY

var pubPoint = key.getPublic();
var x = pubPoint.getX();
var y = pubPoint.getY();

// Public Key MUST be either:
// 1) '04' + hex string of x + hex string of y; or
// 2) object with two hex string properties (x and y); or
// 3) object with two buffer properties (x and y)
var pub = pubPoint.encode('hex');                                 // case 1
var pub = { x: x.toString('hex'), y: y.toString('hex') };         // case 2
var pub = { x: x.toBuffer(), y: y.toBuffer() };                   // case 3
var pub = { x: x.toArrayLike(Buffer), y: y.toArrayLike(Buffer) }; // case 3

// Import public key
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');

// Signature MUST be either:
// 1) DER-encoded signature as hex-string; or
// 2) DER-encoded signature as buffer; or
// 3) object with two hex-string properties (r and s); or
// 4) object with two buffer properties (r and s)

var signature = '3046022100...'; // case 1
var signature = new Buffer('...'); // case 2
var signature = { r: 'b1fc...', s: '9c42...' }; // case 3

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
```

### EdDSA

```javascript
var EdDSA = require('elliptic').eddsa;

// Create and initialize EdDSA context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EdDSA('ed25519');

// Create key pair from secret
var key = ec.keyFromSecret('693e3c...'); // hex string, array or Buffer

// Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string)
var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msgHash).toHex();

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));

// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY

// Import public key
var pub = '0a1af638...';
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');

// Verify signature
var signature = '70bed1...';
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
```

### ECDH

```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
var ec = new EC('curve25519');

// Generate keys
var key1 = ec.genKeyPair();
var key2 = ec.genKeyPair();

var shared1 = key1.derive(key2.getPublic());
var shared2 = key2.derive(key1.getPublic());

console.log('Both shared secrets are BN instances');
console.log(shared1.toString(16));
console.log(shared2.toString(16));
```

three and more members:
```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
var ec = new EC('curve25519');

var A = ec.genKeyPair();
var B = ec.genKeyPair();
var C = ec.genKeyPair();

var AB = A.getPublic().mul(B.getPrivate())
var BC = B.getPublic().mul(C.getPrivate())
var CA = C.getPublic().mul(A.getPrivate())

var ABC = AB.mul(C.getPrivate())
var BCA = BC.mul(A.getPrivate())
var CAB = CA.mul(B.getPrivate())

console.log(ABC.getX().toString(16))
console.log(BCA.getX().toString(16))
console.log(CAB.getX().toString(16))
```

NOTE: `.derive()` returns a [BN][1] instance.

## Supported curves

Elliptic.js support following curve types:

* Short Weierstrass
* Montgomery
* Edwards
* Twisted Edwards

Following curve 'presets' are embedded into the library:

* `secp256k1`
* `p192`
* `p224`
* `p256`
* `p384`
* `p521`
* `curve25519`
* `ed25519`

NOTE: That `curve25519` could not be used for ECDSA, use `ed25519` instead.

### Implementation details

ECDSA is using deterministic `k` value generation as per [RFC6979][0]. Most of
the curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective
or extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.

All operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is
provided by [hash.js][2]

### Related projects

* [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both
  browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for
  node)

> Better [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv)/[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)/[io.js](https://iojs.org) error handling & reporting. Available in npm as *errno*.

## errno exposed

Ever find yourself needing more details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.

**By errno:**

```js
require('errno').errno[3]
// â {
//     "errno": 3,
//     "code": "EACCES",
//     "description": "permission denied"
//   }
```

**By code:**

```js
require('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY
// â {
//     "errno": 53,
//     "code": "ENOTEMPTY",
//     "description": "directory not empty"
//   }
```

**Make your errors more descriptive:**

```js
var errno = require('errno')

function errmsg(err) {
  var str = 'Error: '
  // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno
  if (errno.errno[err.errno])
    str += errno.errno[err.errno].description
  else
    str += err.message

  // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property
  if (err.path)
    str += ' [' + err.path + ']'

  return str
}

var fs = require('fs')

fs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {
  if (err)
    console.log(errmsg(err))
})
```

**Use as a command line tool:**

```
~ $ errno 53
{
  "errno": 53,
  "code": "ENOTEMPTY",
  "description": "directory not empty"
}
~ $ errno EROFS
{
  "errno": 56,
  "code": "EROFS",
  "description": "read-only file system"
}
~ $ errno foo
No such errno/code: "foo"
```

Supply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.

You will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.

<a name="customerrors"></a>
## Custom errors

Use `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.

```js
var create = require('errno').custom.createError
var MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error
var SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError
var OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)

// use them!
if (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')

if (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))
```

Also available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:

```js
fs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {
  if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))
  // do something else
})
```

The resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - esrecurse@4.2.1

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

### Esrecurse [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse)

Esrecurse ([esrecurse](https://github.com/estools/esrecurse)) is
[ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)
recursive traversing functionality.

### Example Usage

The following code will output all variables declared at the root of a file.

```javascript
esrecurse.visit(ast, {
    XXXStatement: function (node) {
        this.visit(node.left);
        // do something...
        this.visit(node.right);
    }
});
```

We can use `Visitor` instance.

```javascript
var visitor = new esrecurse.Visitor({
    XXXStatement: function (node) {
        this.visit(node.left);
        // do something...
        this.visit(node.right);
    }
});

visitor.visit(ast);
```

We can inherit `Visitor` instance easily.

```javascript
class Derived extends esrecurse.Visitor {
    constructor()
    {
        super(null);
    }

    XXXStatement(node) {
    }
}
```

```javascript
function DerivedVisitor() {
    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);
}
util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {
    this.visit(node.left);
    // do something...
    this.visit(node.right);
};
```

And you can invoke default visiting operation inside custom visit operation.

```javascript
function DerivedVisitor() {
    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);
}
util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {
    // do something...
    this.visitChildren(node);
};
```

The `childVisitorKeys` option does customize the behaviour of `this.visitChildren(node)`.
We can use user-defined node types.

```javascript
// This tree contains a user-defined `TestExpression` node.
var tree = {
    type: 'TestExpression',

    // This 'argument' is the property containing the other **node**.
    argument: {
        type: 'Literal',
        value: 20
    },

    // This 'extended' is the property not containing the other **node**.
    extended: true
};
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        // Extending the existing traversing rules.
        childVisitorKeys: {
            // TargetNodeName: [ 'keys', 'containing', 'the', 'other', '**node**' ]
            TestExpression: ['argument']
        }
    }
);
```

We can use the `fallback` option as well.
If the `fallback` option is `"iteration"`, `esrecurse` would visit all enumerable properties of unknown nodes.
Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).

```javascript
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        fallback: 'iteration'
    }
);
```

If the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.
Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).

```javascript
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        fallback: function (node) {
            return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {
                return key !== 'argument'
            });
        }
    }
);
```

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# fb-watchman

`fb-watchman` is a filesystem watcher that uses the
[Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) file watching service from
Facebook.

Watchman provides file change notification services using very
efficient recursive watches and also allows more advanced change matching and
filesystem tree querying operations using
[a powerful expression syntax](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/file-query.html#expressions).

## Install

You should [install Watchman](
https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) to make the most of this
module.

Then simply:

```
$ npm install fb-watchman
```

## Key Concepts

- Watchman recursively watches directories.
- Each watched directory is called a `root`.
- You must initiate a `watch` on a `root` using the `watch-project` command prior to subscribing to changes
- Rather than separately watching many sibling directories, `watch-project` consolidates and re-uses existing watches relative to a project root (the location of your `.watchmanconfig` or source control repository root)
- change notifications are relative to the project root

## How do I use it?

[Read the NodeJS watchman documentation](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/nodejs.html)

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - find-node-modules@1.0.4

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# find-node-modules

This is a little node module to find the path of every parent node_modules
directory. It's useful for things like Sass, where you can't specify the exact
path to individual modules (in which case [findup-sync] would be sufficient),
and you can't just give an array of parent node_modules which might exist,
because it will error if they don't.

In most cases you're trying to find node_modules directories, findup-sync
should be sufficient. This library is specifically for if you want an array
containing all the parent node_modules paths. If you loop through the output
of this library, you should be using findup-sync instead.

## Install

```
$ npm install --save find-node-modules
```

## Usage

```js
var findNodeModules = require('find-node-modules');

findNodeModules();
//=> ['node_modules', '../../node_modules']

findNodeModules({ cwd: './someDir' });
//=> ['../node_modules', '../../../node_modules']

findNodeModules('./someDir');
//=> ['../node_modules', '../../../node_modules']

findNodeModules({ cwd: './someDir', relative: false });
//=> ['/path/to/something/node_modules', '/path/node_modules']
```

```js
var logo = document.getElementById('logo');

listen(logo, 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e);
});
```

Or by passing a list of HTML elements [(see full demo)](https://github.com/zenorocha/good-listener/blob/master/demo/nodelist.html).

```js
var anchors = document.querySelectorAll('a');

listen(anchors, 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e);
});
```

### Remove an event listener

By calling the `destroy` function that returned from previous operation [(see full demo)](https://github.com/zenorocha/good-listener/blob/master/demo/destroy.html).

```js
var listener = listen('.btn', 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e);

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - growly@1.3.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# Growly #

Simple zero-dependency Growl notifications using GNTP.

## Installation ##

Install growly using `npm`:

```
npm install growly
```

And then require it:

```javascript
var growly = require('growly');
```

This module uses the Growl Network Transport Protocol (GNTP) which was implemented in Growl since version 1.3, so you **must have an appropriate version of Growl installed** for Growly to work.

## Example ##

Sending a minimal Growl notification:

```javascript
var growly = require('growly');

growly.notify('This is as easy as it gets', { title: 'Hello, World!' });
```

More examples can be found in the *example/* directory.

## Usage ##

The growly module exposes only three methods: `Growly.register()`, `Growly.notify()`, and `Growly.setHost()`.

### Growly.register(appname, [appicon], [notifications], [callback]) ###

Registers a new application with Growl. Registration is completely optional since it will be performed automatically for you with sensible defaults. Useful if you want your application, with its own icon and types of notifications, to show up in Growl's prefence panel.

  - `appname` the name of the application (required.)
  - `appicon` url, file path, or Buffer instance for an application icon image.
  - `notifications` a list of defined notification types with the following properties:
    - `.label` name used to identify the type of notification being used (required.)
    - `.dispname` name users will see in Growl's preference panel (defaults to `.label`.)
    - `.enabled` whether or not notifications of this type are enabled (defaults to true.)
  - `callback` called when the registration completes; if registration fails, the first argument will be an Error object.

An example:

```javascript
growly.register('My Application', 'path/to/icon.png', [
    { label: 'success', dispname: 'Success' },
    { label: 'warning', dispname: 'Warning', enabled: false }
], function(err) {
    console.log(err || 'Registration successful!');
});
```

### Growly.notify(text, [opts], [callback]) ###

Sends a Growl notification. If an application wasn't registered beforehand with `growly.register()`, a default application will automatically be registered beforesending the notification.

  - `text` the body of the notification.
  - `opts` an object with the following properties:
    - `.title` title of the notification.
    - `.icon` url, file path, or Buffer instance for the notification's icon.
    - `.sticky` whether or not to sticky the notification (defaults to false.)
    - `.label` type of notification to use (defaults to the first registered notification type.)
    - `.priority` the priority of the notification from lowest (-2) to highest (2).
    - `.coalescingId` replace/update the matching previous notification. May be ignored.
  - `callback` called when the user has closed/clicked the notification. The callback is passed an Error object `err` as the first argument when the notification fails; otherwise, the second argument `action` is a string that'll describe which action has been taken by the user (either 'closed' or 'clicked'.)

An example:

```javascript
/* Assuming an application was registered with a notification type labeled 'warning'. */
growly.notify('Stuffs broken!', { label: 'warning' }, function(err, action) {
    console.log('Action:', action);
});
```

### Growly.setHost(host, port) ###

Set the host and port that Growl (GNTP) requests will be sent to. Using this method is optional since GNTP defaults to using host 'localhost' and port 23053.

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - gud@1.0.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# gud

> Create a 'gud nuff' (not cryptographically secure) globally unique id

## Install

```
yarn add gud
```

## Usage

```js
const gud = require('gud');

console.log(gud()); // 1
console.log(gud()); // 2
```

This is ever so slightly better than using something like `_.uniqueId` because
it will work across multiple copies of the same module.

Do not use this in place of actual UUIDs, security folks will hate me.

This will not be unique across processes/workers.

# html-parse-stringify2

## Quick note

This is a fork of [html-parse-stringify](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/html-parse-stringify) that I made because I wanted to get some important fixes into the repo and available as an NPM package and I'm not sure whether the old repo is still being maintained. Hence this. This could be temporary - I'll gladly drop this if activity picks back up on the original repo. But for now we've got a new npm package `html-parse-stringify2`. Install with:

```
npm install --save html-parse-stringify2
```

Use as documented below...

### OK, on to the original README...

This is an *experimental lightweight approach* to enable quickly parsing HTML into an AST and stringify'ing it back to the original string.

As it turns out, if you can make a the simplifying assumptions about HTML that all tags must be closed or self-closing. Which is OK for *this* particular application. You can write a super light/fast parser in JS with regex.

"Why on earth would you do this?! Haven't you read: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags ?!?!"

Why yes, yes I have :)

But the truth is. If you *could* do this in a whopping grand total of ~600 bytes (min+gzip) as this repo shows. It potentially enables DOM diffing based on a HTML strings to be super light and fast in a browser. What is that you say? DOM-diffing?

Yes.

React.js essentially pioneered the approach. With Reach you render to a "virtual DOM" whenever you want to, and the virtual DOM can then diff against the real DOM (or the last virtual DOM) and then turn that diff into whatever transformations are necessary to get the *real* DOM to match what you rendered as efficiently as possible.

As a result, when you're building a single page app, you don't have to worry so much about bindings. Instead, you simple re-render to the virtual DOM whenever you know something's changed. All of a sudden being able to have `change` events for individual properties becomes less important, instead you can just reference those values in your template whenever you think something changed.

Cool idea, right?!

## So why this?

Well, there are other things React expects me to do if I use it that I don't like. Such as the custom templating and syntax you have to use.

If, hypothetically, you could instead diff an HTML string (generated by *whatever* templating language of your choice) against the DOM, then you'd get the same benefit, sans React's impositions.

This may all turn out to be a bad idea altogether, but initial results seem promising when paired with [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom).

But you can't just diff HTML strings, as simple strings, very easily, in order to diff two HTML node trees you have to first turn that string into a tree structure of some sort. Typically, the thing you generate from parsing something like this is called an AST (abstract syntax tree).

This lib does exactly that.

It has two methods:

1. parse
2. stringify

## `.parse(htmlString, options)`

Takes a string of HTML and turns it into an AST, the only option you can currently pass is an object of registered `components` whose children will be ignored when generating the AST.

## `.stringify(AST)`

Takes an AST and turns it back into a string of HTML.

## What does the AST look like?

See comments in the following example:

```js
var HTML = require('html-parse-stringify2')

// this html:
var html = '<div class="oh"><p>hi</p></div>';

// becomes this AST:
var ast = HTML.parse(html);


console.log(ast);
/*
{
    // can be `tag`, `text` or `component`
    type: 'tag',

    // name of tag if relevant
    name: 'div',

    // parsed attribute object
    attrs: {
        class: 'oh'
    },

    // whether this is a self-closing tag
    // such as <img/>
    voidElement: false,

    // an array of child nodes
    // we see the same structure
    // repeated in each of these
    children: [
        {
            type: 'tag',
            name: 'p',
            attrs: {},
            voidElement: false,
            children: [
                // this is a text node
                // it also has a `type`
                // but nothing other than
                // a `content` containing
                // its text.
                {
                    type: 'text',
                    content: 'hi'
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
*/
```

## the AST node types

### 1. tag

properties:

- `type` - will always be `tag` for this type of node
- `name` - tag name, such as 'div'
- `attrs` - an object of key/value pairs. If an attribute has multiple space-separated items such as classes, they'll still be in a single string, for example: `class: "class1 class2"`
- `voidElement` - `true` or `false`. Whether this tag is a known void element as defined by [spec](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/syntax.html#void-elements).
- `children` - array of child nodes. Note that any continuous string of text is a text node child, see below.

### 2. text

properties:

- `type` - will always be `text` for this type of node
- `content` - text content of the node

### 3. component

If you pass an object of `components` as part of the `options` object passed as the second argument to `.parse()` then the AST won't keep parsing that branch of the DOM tree when it one of those registered components.

This is so that it's possible to ignore sections of the tree that you may want to handle by another "subview" in your application that handles it's own DOM diffing.

properties:

- `type` - will always be `component` for this type of node
- `name` - tag name, such as 'div'
- `attrs` - an object of key/value pairs. If an attribute has multiple space-separated items such as classes, they'll still be in a single string, for example: `class: "class1 class2"`
- `voidElement` - `true` or `false`. Whether this tag is a known void element as defined by [spec](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/syntax.html#void-elements).
- `children` - it will still have a `children` array, but it will always be empty.

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

iMurmurHash.js
==============

An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).

This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.

Installation
------------

To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js"></script>
<script>
// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3
</script>
```

---

To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:

```bash
npm install imurmurhash
```

Then simply include it in your scripts:

```javascript
MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');
```

Quick Example
-------------

```javascript
// Create the initial hash
var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');

// Incrementally add text
hashState.hash('more strings');
hashState.hash('even more strings');

// All calls can be chained if desired
hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');

// Get a result
hashState.result();
// returns 0xe4ccfe6b
```

Functions
---------

### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])
Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:

```javascript
// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same
// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)
hashState = MurmurHash3();
...

// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the
// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss
// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.
hashState = new MurmurHash3();
```

Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)
Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()
Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.

```javascript
// Do the whole string at once
MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();
// 0x70529328

// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part
var m = MurmurHash3('this is a');
m.result();
// 0xbfc4f834
m.hash(' test string').result();
// 0x70529328 (same as above)
```

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])
Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

GPL version 3
=============

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - load-script@1.0.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# load-script

Dynamic script loading.

## Installation

via component

```
$ component install eldargab/load-script
```

via npm

```
$ npm install load-script
```

## API
`load-script` appends a `script` node to the `<head>` element in the dom.

`require('load-script')` returns a function of the following interface:  `function(url[, opts][, cb]) {}`

### url
Any url that you would like to load.  May be absolute or relative.

### [, opts]
A map of options.  Here are the currently supported options:

* `async` - A boolean value used for `script.async`.  By default this is `true`.
* `attrs` - A map of attributes to set on the `script` node before appending it to the DOM.  By default this is empty.
* `charset` - A string value used for `script.charset`.  By default this is `utf8`.
* `text` - A string of text to append to the `script` node before it is appended to the DOM.  By default this is empty.
* `type` - A string used for `script.type`.  By default this is `text/javascript`.

### [, cb]
A callback function of the following interface: `function(err, script) {}` where `err` is an error if any occurred and `script` is the `script` node that was appended to the DOM.

## Example Usage

```javascript
var load = require('load-script')

load('foo.js', function (err, script) {
  if (err) {
    // print useful message
  }
  else {
    console.log(script.src);// Prints 'foo'.js'
    // use script
    // note that in IE8 and below loading error wouldn't be reported
  }
})
```

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Natural Compare &ndash; [![Build][]][1] [![Coverage][]][2]
===============

Compare strings containing a mix of letters and numbers
in the way a human being would in sort order.
This is described as a "natural ordering".

```text
Standard sorting:   Natural order sorting:
    img1.png            img1.png
    img10.png           img2.png
    img12.png           img10.png
    img2.png            img12.png
```

String.naturalCompare returns a number indicating
whether a reference string comes before or after or is the same
as the given string in sort order.
Use it with builtin sort() function.



### Installation

- In browser

```html
<script src=min.natural-compare.js></script>
```

- In node.js: `npm install natural-compare-lite`

```javascript
require("natural-compare-lite")
```

### Usage

```javascript
// Simple case sensitive example
var a = ["z1.doc", "z10.doc", "z17.doc", "z2.doc", "z23.doc", "z3.doc"];
a.sort(String.naturalCompare);
// ["z1.doc", "z2.doc", "z3.doc", "z10.doc", "z17.doc", "z23.doc"]

// Use wrapper function for case insensitivity
a.sort(function(a, b){
  return String.naturalCompare(a.toLowerCase(), b.toLowerCase());
})

// In most cases we want to sort an array of objects
var a = [ {"street":"350 5th Ave", "room":"A-1021"}
        , {"street":"350 5th Ave", "room":"A-21046-b"} ];

// sort by street, then by room
a.sort(function(a, b){
  return String.naturalCompare(a.street, b.street) || String.naturalCompare(a.room, b.room);
})

// When text transformation is needed (eg toLowerCase()),
// it is best for performance to keep
// transformed key in that object.
// There are no need to do text transformation
// on each comparision when sorting.
var a = [ {"make":"Audi", "model":"A6"}
        , {"make":"Kia",  "model":"Rio"} ];

// sort by make, then by model
a.map(function(car){
  car.sort_key = (car.make + " " + car.model).toLowerCase();
})
a.sort(function(a, b){
  return String.naturalCompare(a.sort_key, b.sort_key);
})
```

- Works well with dates in ISO format eg "Rev 2012-07-26.doc".


### Custom alphabet

It is possible to configure a custom alphabet
to achieve a desired order.

```javascript
// Estonian alphabet
String.alphabet = "ABDEFGHIJKLMNOPRSÅ ZÅ½TUVÃÃÃÃXYabdefghijklmnoprsÅ¡zÅ¾tuvÃµÃ¤Ã¶Ã¼xy"
["t", "z", "x", "Ãµ"].sort(String.naturalCompare)
// ["z", "t", "Ãµ", "x"]

// Russian alphabet
String.alphabet = "ÐÐÐÐÐÐÐÐÐÐÐÐÐÐÐÐÐÐ Ð¡Ð¢Ð£Ð¤Ð¥Ð¦Ð§Ð¨Ð©ÐªÐ«Ð¬Ð­Ð®Ð¯Ð°Ð±Ð²Ð³Ð´ÐµÑÐ¶Ð·Ð¸Ð¹ÐºÐ»Ð¼Ð½Ð¾Ð¿ÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑ"
["Ð", "Ð", "Ð"].sort(String.naturalCompare)
// ["Ð", "Ð", "Ð"]
```

# pkcs7 [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/brightcove/pkcs7.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/brightcove/pkcs7)

> Add and remove pkcs7-style padding.


## Getting Started

Install the module with: `npm install pkcs7`

```js
var pkcs7 = require('pkcs7'), encrypted;
// pad a buffer!
enctcrypted = encrypt(pkcs7.pad(buffer));

// later, you can unpad it:
console.log('the secret is out! ' + pkcs7.unpad(decrypt(encrypted)));
```

Install with cli command

```sh
$ npm install -g pkcs7
$ pkcs7 --help
$ pkcs7 --version
```

## Documentation

PKCS#7 padding a really simple transformation some crytographic algorithms use to ensure the number of input bytes is a multiple of some constant. Here's how it works:

             01 -- if lth mod k = k-1
          02 02 -- if lth mod k = k-2
              .
              .
              .
    k k ... k k -- if lth mod k = 0

`k` is the constant value the encryption algorithm wants your input to be a multiple of. This project assumes `k` is *always* sixteen. Not much to it, right? If reading specs is your thing, check out [RFC 5652](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652).


## Examples

You can run pkcs7 from the command line:

```shell
# pad a string generated by echo and the hex dump the result
echo -n "0123456789AB" | pkcs7 | xxd
```

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - pn@1.1.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# pn
[![NPM][NPM1]][NPM2]

[![Build Status][1]][2]

The `pn` library gives you the Promise-using node standard library
you've always dreamed of.  Think "Promised Node" when saying it.

Just about every node standard library method that takes a callback will now
return a `Promise` iff no callback is supplied.  But existing code
that passes callbacks will still work fine --- and fast:  No unnecessary
`Promise`s are created if you supply a callback.

The wrappers are generated automatically by a script, with a table to
handle exceptions and odd cases.  See below for more details.

## Installation
```
npm install pn
```
## Usage
```
var fs = require('pn/fs');
fs.writeFile('foo', 'bar', 'utf-8').then(function() { console.log('done'); });
// But you can use callbacks, too -- existing code won't break.
fs.writeFile('foo', 'bat', 'utf-8', function(err) { console.log('yay'); });
```

This library uses node native promises (ie `global.Promise`) by
default, and thus works with node >= 0.11.

You can use [`core-js`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/core-js) or
[`es6-shim`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/es6-shim)
to add ES6 Promises to earlier versions of node, for example:
```
require('es6-shim');
var fs = require('pn/fs');
```
Just be sure that `es6-shim` is loaded before the `pn` package in that
case.

You might also want to look into packages like
[`prfun`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/prfun)
which add some helpers to make working with native promises much more
fun.

In particular, the `Promise#done` method is very useful when
debugging, at least until v8's native Promise debugging
capabilities are completed.

## Custom Promise types

You can also specify a custom `Promise` type to use, as follows:
```
var MyPromise = require('prfun');  // Use prfun's Promises, for example.
require('pn/_promise')(MyPromise); // This only needs to be done once.
```

## Exceptions and odd cases

The wrappers are automatically generated by `scripts/generate.js`;
there is a table in that file which specifies all the odd cases.

In general: if the node API has a callback which takes multiple
value arguments, the `Promise` returned will be an object with
named fields corresponding to the different values. If the node
API takes a callback *and* returns a value, `pn` will return
the original value with a nonenumerable field named `promise`
corresponding to the callback.  Combining these two cases:
```
var child_process = require('pn/child_process');
var cp = child_process.execFile('true');
console.log('pid', cp.pid);
cp.promise.then(function(result) {
  console.log('stdout: ', result.stdout);
  console.log('stderr: ', result.stderr);
});
```

* `child_process`: The `exec` and `execFile` methods promise a object
  with fields named `stdout` and `stderr`.  They return a `ChildProcess`
  object with a nonenumerable field named `promise` corresponding to the
  callback.
* `crypto`: The `randomBytes` and `pseudoRandomBytes` methods are
  now always asynchronous, returning a `Promise` if no callback
  is supplied.  Use the new `randomBytesSync` and `pseudoRandomBytesSync`
  methods if you want synchronous computation.  *This is backwards
  incompatible with existing node code.*
* `dns`: The `lookupService` method promises an object with
  fields named `hostname` and `service`.
* `fs`: The `exists` method doesn't pass an error to its callback.
  The promisied version will never reject.  The `write` method promises
  an object with fields named `written` and `data`.  The `read` method
  promises an object with fields named `read` and `data`.
* `http`, `https`: The `request` and `get` methods return a `ClientRequest`
  object with a nonenumerable field named `promise`, which will
  resolve to an `IncomingMessage` object.
* `process`: You can defer computation to the next tick with
  `require('pn/process').nextTick().then(function(){...})`
* `tls`: The `connect` and `createServer` return objects with a
  nonenumerable field named `promise`.

There are a few object methods which are not promisified by this
package:
* `domain`: `Domain#bind`, `Domain#intercept`
* `http`,`https`: `ClientRequest#setTimeout`, `IncomingMessage#setTimeout`,
  `Server#setTimeout`, `ServerResponse#setTimeout`, `Server#listen`,
  `Server#close`
* `net`: `Server#listen`, `Server#close`, `Server#getConnections`,
  `Socket#write`, `Socket#setTimeout`
* `readline`: `Interface#question`
* `stream`: `Writable#write`, `Writable#end`
* `dgram`: `Socket#send`, `Socket#bind`.

<!-- ð¨ HEY! HERE BEGINS THE INTERESTING STUFF ð¨ -->

## Wut? Poppers?

A popper is an element on the screen which "pops out" from the natural flow of your application.
Common examples of poppers are tooltips, popovers and drop-downs.


## So, yet another tooltip library?

Well, basically, **no**.
Popper.js is a **positioning engine**, its purpose is to calculate the position of an element
to make it possible to position it near a given reference element.

The engine is completely modular and most of its features are implemented as **modifiers**
(similar to middlewares or plugins).
The whole code base is written in ES2015 and its features are automatically tested on real browsers thanks to [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/) and [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/).

Popper.js has zero dependencies. No jQuery, no LoDash, nothing.
It's used by big companies like [Twitter in Bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Microsoft in WebClipper](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/WebClipper) and [Atlassian in AtlasKit](https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/atlaskit/registry/).

### Popper.js

This is the engine, the library that computes and, optionally, applies the styles to
the poppers.

Some of the key points are:

- Position elements keeping them in their original DOM context (doesn't mess with your DOM!);
- Allows to export the computed informations to integrate with React and other view libraries;
- Supports Shadow DOM elements;
- Completely customizable thanks to the modifiers based structure;

Visit our [project page](https://fezvrasta.github.io/popper.js) to see a lot of examples of what you can do with Popper.js!

Find [the documentation here](/docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md).


### Tooltip.js

Since lots of users just need a simple way to integrate powerful tooltips in their projects,
we created **Tooltip.js**.
It's a small library that makes it easy to automatically create tooltips using as engine Popper.js.
Its API is almost identical to the famous tooltip system of Bootstrap, in this way it will be
easy to integrate it in your projects.
The tooltips generated by Tooltip.js are accessible thanks to the `aria` tags.

Find [the documentation here](/docs/_includes/tooltip-documentation.md).

\*: Bower isn't officially supported, it can be used to install Tooltip.js only trough the unpkg.com CDN. This method has the limitation of not being able to define a specific version of the library. Bower and Popper.js suggests to use npm or Yarn for your projects.
For more info, [read the related issue](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/390).

### Dist targets

Popper.js is currently shipped with 3 targets in mind: UMD, ESM and ESNext.

- UMD - Universal Module Definition: AMD, RequireJS and globals;
- ESM - ES Modules: For webpack/Rollup or browser supporting the spec;
- ESNext: Available in `dist/`, can be used with webpack and `babel-preset-env`;

Make sure to use the right one for your needs. If you want to import it with a `<script>` tag, use UMD.

## Usage

Given an existing popper DOM node, ask Popper.js to position it near its button

```js
var reference = document.querySelector('.my-button');
var popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper');
var anotherPopper = new Popper(
    reference,
    popper,
    {
        // popper options here
    }
);
```

### Callbacks

Popper.js supports two kinds of callbacks, the `onCreate` callback is called after
the popper has been initialized. The `onUpdate` one is called on any subsequent update.

```js
const reference = document.querySelector('.my-button');
const popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper');
new Popper(reference, popper, {
    onCreate: (data) => {
        // data is an object containing all the informations computed
        // by Popper.js and used to style the popper and its arrow
        // The complete description is available in Popper.js documentation
    },
    onUpdate: (data) => {
        // same as `onCreate` but called on subsequent updates
    }
});
```

### Writing your own modifiers

Popper.js is based on a "plugin-like" architecture, most of its features are fully encapsulated "modifiers".
A modifier is a function that is called each time Popper.js needs to compute the position of the popper. For this reason, modifiers should be very performant to avoid bottlenecks.

To learn how to create a modifier, [read the modifiers documentation](docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md#modifiers--object)


### React, Vue.js, Angular, AngularJS, Ember.js (etc...) integration

Integrating 3rd party libraries in React or other libraries can be a pain because
they usually alter the DOM and drive the libraries crazy.
Popper.js limits all its DOM modifications inside the `applyStyle` modifier,
you can simply disable it and manually apply the popper coordinates using
your library of choice.

For a comprehensive list of libraries that let you use Popper.js into existing
frameworks, visit the [MENTIONS](/MENTIONS.md) page.

Alternatively, you may even override your own `applyStyles` with your custom one and
integrate Popper.js by yourself!

```js
function applyReactStyle(data) {
    // export data in your framework and use its content to apply the style to your popper
};

const reference = document.querySelector('.my-button');
const popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper');
new Popper(reference, popper, {
    modifiers: {
        applyStyle: { enabled: false },
        applyReactStyle: {
            enabled: true,
            fn: applyReactStyle,
            order: 800,
        },
    },
});

```

### Migration from Popper.js v0

Since the API changed, we prepared some migration instructions to make it easy to upgrade to
Popper.js v1.

https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/62

Feel free to comment inside the issue if you have any questions.

### Performances

Popper.js is very performant. It usually takes 0.5ms to compute a popper's position (on an iMac with 3.5G GHz Intel Core i5).
This means that it will not cause any [jank](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/trace-event-profiling-tool/anatomy-of-jank), leading to a smooth user experience.

## Notes

### Libraries using Popper.js

The aim of Popper.js is to provide a stable and powerful positioning engine ready to
be used in 3rd party libraries.

Visit the [MENTIONS](/MENTIONS.md) page for an updated list of projects.

CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
  and translate a Work;

  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
  depicted in a Work;

  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
  a Work;

  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
  any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
  or other rights required for any use of the Work.

# An onClickOutside wrapper for React components

This is a React Higher Order Component (HOC) that you can use with your own
React components if you want to have them listen for clicks that occur somewhere
in the document, outside of the element itself (for instance, if you need to
hide a menu when people click anywhere else on your page).

Note that this HOC relies on the `.classList` property, which is supported by
all modern browsers, but not by deprecated and obsolete browsers like IE (noting
that Microsoft Edge is not Microsoft Internet Explorer. Edge does not have any
problems with the `classList` property for SVG elements). If your code relies on
classList in any way, you want to use a polyfill like
[dom4](https://github.com/WebReflection/dom4).

This HOC supports stateless components as of v5.7.0, and switched to using
transpiled es6 classes rather than `createClass` as of v6.

## Installation

Use `npm`:

```
$> npm install react-onclickoutside --save
```

(or `--save-dev` depending on your needs). You then use it in your components
as:


## Usage

### ES6 Class Component

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import onClickOutside from "react-onclickoutside";

class MyComponent extends Component {
  handleClickOutside = evt => {
    // ..handling code goes here...
  };
}

export default onClickOutside(MyComponent);
```

### Functional Component with UseState Hook

```js
import React, { useState } from "react";
import onClickOutside from "react-onclickoutside";

const Menu = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
  const toggle = () => setIsOpen(!isOpen);
  Menu.handleClickOutside = () => setIsOpen(false);
  return (
      //...
  )
};

const clickOutsideConfig = {
  handleClickOutside: () => Menu.handleClickOutside
};

export default onClickOutside(Menu, clickOutsideConfig);
```

Example: https://codesandbox.io/s/vn66kq7mml


### CommonJS Require

```js
// .default is needed because library is bundled as ES6 module
var onClickOutside = require("react-onclickoutside").default;
var createReactClass = require("create-react-class");

// create a new component, wrapped by this onclickoutside HOC:
var MyComponent = onClickOutside(
  createReactClass({
    // ...,
    handleClickOutside: function(evt) {
      // ...handling code goes here...
    }
    // ...
  })
);
```

### Ensuring there is a click handler

Note that if you try to wrap a React component class without a
`handleClickOutside(evt)` handler like this, the HOC will throw an error. In
order to use a custom event handler, you can specify the function to be used by
the HOC as second parameter (this can be useful in environments like TypeScript,
where the fact that the wrapped component does not implement the handler can be
flagged at compile-time):

```js
// load the HOC:
import React, { Component } from "react";
import onClickOutside from "react-onclickoutside";

// create a new component, wrapped below by onClickOutside HOC:
class MyComponent extends Component {
  // ...
  myClickOutsideHandler(evt) {
    // ...handling code goes here...
  }
  // ...
}
var clickOutsideConfig = {
  handleClickOutside: function(instance) {
    return instance.myClickOutsideHandler;
  }
};
var EnhancedComponent = onClickOutside(MyComponent, clickOutsideConfig);
```

Note that if you try to wrap a React component with a custom handler that the
component does not implement, the HOC will throw an error at run-time.

## Regulate which events to listen for

By default, "outside clicks" are based on both `mousedown` and `touchstart`
events; if that is what you need, then you do not need to specify anything
special. However, if you need different events, you can specify these using the
`eventTypes` property. If you just need one event, you can pass in the event
name as plain string:

```js
<MyComponent eventTypes="click" ... />
```

For multiple events, you can pass in the array of event names you need to listen
for:

```js
<MyComponent eventTypes={["click", "touchend"]} ... />
```

## Regulate whether or not to listen for outside clicks

Wrapped components have two functions that can be used to explicitly listen for,
or do nothing with, outside clicks

* `enableOnClickOutside()` - Enables outside click listening by setting up the
  event listening bindings.
* `disableOnClickOutside()` - Disables outside click listening by explicitly
  removing the event listening bindings.

In addition, you can create a component that uses this HOC such that it has the
code set up and ready to go, but not listening for outside click events until
you explicitly issue its `enableOnClickOutside()`, by passing in a properly
called `disableOnClickOutside`:

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import onClickOutside from "react-onclickoutside";

class MyComponent extends Component {
  // ...
  handleClickOutside(evt) {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
var EnhancedComponent = onClickOutside(MyComponent);

class Container extends Component {
  render(evt) {
    return <EnhancedComponent disableOnClickOutside={true} />;
  }
}
```

Using `disableOnClickOutside()` or `enableOnClickOutside()` within
`componentDidMount` or `componentWillMount` is considered an anti-pattern, and
does not have consistent behaviour when using the mixin and HOC/ES7 Decorator.
Favour setting the `disableOnClickOutside` property on the component.

## Regulate whether or not to listen to scrollbar clicks

By default this HOC will listen for "clicks inside the document", which may
include clicks that occur on the scrollbar. Quite often clicking on the
scrollbar _should_ close whatever is open but in case your project invalidates
that assumption you can use the `excludeScrollbar` property to explicitly tell
the HOC that clicks on the scrollbar should be ignored:

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import onClickOutside from "react-onclickoutside";

class MyComponent extends Component {
  // ...
}
var EnhancedComponent = onClickOutside(MyComponent);

class Container extends Component {
  render(evt) {
    return <EnhancedComponent excludeScrollbar={true} />;
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can specify this behavior as default for all instances of
your component passing a configuration object as second parameter:

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import onClickOutside from "react-onclickoutside";

class MyComponent extends Component {
  // ...
}
var clickOutsideConfig = {
  excludeScrollbar: true
};
var EnhancedComponent = onClickOutside(MyComponent, clickOutsideConfig);
```

## Regulating `evt.preventDefault()` and `evt.stopPropagation()`

Technically this HOC lets you pass in `preventDefault={true/false}` and
`stopPropagation={true/false}` to regulate what happens to the event when it
hits your `handleClickOutside(evt)` function, but beware: `stopPropagation` may
not do what you expect it to do.

Each component adds new event listeners to the document, which may or may not
cause as many event triggers as there are event listening bindings. In the test
file found in `./test/browser/index.html`, the coded uses
`stopPropagation={true}` but sibling events still make it to "parents".

## Marking elements as "skip over this one" during the event loop

If you want the HOC to ignore certain elements, you can tell the HOC which CSS
class name it should use for this purposes. If you want explicit control over
the class name, use `outsideClickIgnoreClass={some string}` as component
property, or if you don't, the default string used is
`ignore-react-onclickoutside`.

## Older React code: "What happened to the Mixin??"

Due to ES2015/ES6 `class` syntax making mixins essentially impossible, and the
fact that HOC wrapping works perfectly fine in ES5 and older versions of React,
as of this package's version 5.0.0 no Mixin is offered anymore.

If you _absolutely_ need a mixin... you really don't.

### But how can I access my component? It has an API that I rely on!

No, I get that. I constantly have that problem myself, so while there is no
universal agreement on how to do that, this HOC offers a `getInstance()`
function that you can call for a reference to the component you wrapped, so that
you can call its API without headaches:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import onClickOutside from 'react-onclickoutside'

class MyComponent extends Component {
  // ...
  handleClickOutside(evt) {
    // ...
  }
  ...
}
var EnhancedComponent = onClickOutside(MyComponent);

class Container extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.getMyComponentRef = this.getMyComponentRef.bind(this);
  }

  someFunction() {
    var ref = this.myComponentRef;
    // 1) Get the wrapped component instance:
    var superTrueMyComponent = ref.getInstance();
    // and call instance functions defined for it:
    superTrueMyComponent.customFunction();
  }

  getMyComponentRef(ref) {
    this.myComponentRef = ref;
  }

  render(evt) {
    return <EnhancedComponent disableOnClickOutside={true} ref={this.getMyComponentRef}/>
  }
}
```

Note that there is also a `getClass()` function, to get the original Class that
was passed into the HOC wrapper, but if you find yourself needing this you're
probably doing something wrong: you really want to define your classes as real,
require'able etc. units, and then write wrapped components separately, so that
you can always access the original class's `statics` etc. properties without
needing to extract them out of a HOC.

## Which version do I need for which version of React?

If you use **React 0.12 or 0.13**, **version 2.4 and below** will work.

If you use **React 0.14**, use **v2.5 through v4.9**, as these specifically use
`react-DOM` for the necessary DOM event bindings.

If you use **React 15**, you can use **v4.x, which offers both a mixin and HOC,
or use v5.x, which is HOC-only**.

If you use **React 15.5**, you can use **v5.11.x**, which relies on
`createClass` as supplied by `create-react-class` rather than
`React.createClass`.

If you use **React 16** or 15.5 in preparation of 16, use v6.x, which uses pure
class notation.

### Support-wise, only the latest version will receive updates and bug fixes.

I do not believe in perpetual support for outdated libraries, so if you find one
of the older versions is not playing nice with an even older React: you know
what to do, and it's not "keep using that old version of React".

## IE does not support classList for SVG elements!

This is true, but also an edge-case problem that only exists for IE11 (as all
versions prior to 11 [no longer exist](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17454/lifecycle-faq-internet-explorer)), and should be addressed by you, rather
than by thousands of individual libraries that assume browsers have proper
HTML API  implementations (IE Edge has proper `classList` support even for SVG).

If you need this to work, you can add a shim for `classList` to your page(s),
loaded before you load your React code, and you'll have instantly fixed _every_
library that you might remotely rely on that makes use of the `classList`
property. You can find several shims quite easily, a good one to start with is
the [dom4](https://github.com/WebReflection/dom4) shim, which adds all manner of
good DOM4 properties to "not quite at DOM4 yet" browser implementations.

Eventually this problem will stop being one, but in the mean time _you_ are
responsible for making _your_ site work by shimming everything that needs
shimming for IE. As such, **if you file a PR to fix classList-and-SVG issues
specifically for this library, your PR will be closed and I will politely point
you to this README.md section**. I will not accept PRs to fix this issue. You
already have the power to fix it, and I expect you to take responsibility as a
fellow developer to shim what you need instead of getting obsolete quirks
supported by libraries whose job isn't to support obsolete quirks.

To work around the issue you can use this simple shim:

```js
if (!("classList" in SVGElement.prototype)) {
  Object.defineProperty(SVGElement.prototype, "classList", {
    get() {
      return {
        contains: className => {
          return this.className.baseVal.split(" ").indexOf(className) !== -1;
        }
      };
    }
  });
}
```

## I can't find what I need in the README

If you've read the whole thing and you still can't find what you were looking
for, then the README is missing important information that should be added in.
Please [file an issue](https://github.com/Pomax/react-onclickoutside/issues) with a request for additional documentation,
describing what you were hoping to find in enough detail that it can be used to
write up the information you needed.

# React-Select

The Select control for [React](https://reactjs.com). Initially built for use in [KeystoneJS](http://www.keystonejs.com).

See [react-select.com](https://www.react-select.com) for live demos and comprehensive docs.

See our [upgrade guide](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/3585) for a breakdown on how to upgrade from v2 to v3.

React Select is funded by [Thinkmill](https://www.thinkmill.com.au) and [Atlassian](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com). It represents a whole new approach to developing powerful React.js components that _just work_ out of the box, while being extremely customisable.

Features include:

- Flexible approach to data, with customisable functions
- Extensible styling API with [emotion](https://emotion.sh)
- Component Injection API for complete control over the UI behaviour
- Controllable state props and modular architecture
- Long-requested features like option groups, portal support, animation, and more

If you're interested in the background, watch Jed's [talk on React Select](https://youtu.be/Eb2wy-HNGMo) at ReactNYC in March 2018.

See our [upgrade guide](https://react-select.com/upgrade-guide) for a breakdown on how to upgrade from v1 to v2.

The old docs and examples will continue to be available at [v1.react-select.com](https://v1.react-select.com).

# Installation and usage

The easiest way to use react-select is to install it from npm and build it into your app with Webpack.

```
yarn add react-select
```

Then use it in your app:

```js
import React from 'react';
import Select from 'react-select';

const options = [
  { value: 'chocolate', label: 'Chocolate' },
  { value: 'strawberry', label: 'Strawberry' },
  { value: 'vanilla', label: 'Vanilla' },
];

class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    selectedOption: null,
  };
  handleChange = selectedOption => {
    this.setState({ selectedOption });
    console.log(`Option selected:`, selectedOption);
  };
  render() {
    const { selectedOption } = this.state;

    return (
      <Select
        value={selectedOption}
        onChange={this.handleChange}
        options={options}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

## Props

Common props you may want to specify include:

- `autoFocus` - focus the control when it mounts
- `className` - apply a className to the control
- `classNamePrefix` - apply classNames to inner elements with the given prefix
- `isDisabled` - disable the control
- `isMulti` - allow the user to select multiple values
- `isSearchable` - allow the user to search for matching options
- `name` - generate an HTML input with this name, containing the current value
- `onChange` - subscribe to change events
- `options` - specify the options the user can select from
- `placeholder` - change the text displayed when no option is selected
- `value` - control the current value

See the [props documentation](https://www.react-select.com/props) for complete documentation on the props react-select supports.

## Controllable Props

You can control the following props by providing values for them. If you don't, react-select will manage them for you.

- `value` / `onChange` - specify the current value of the control
- `menuIsOpen` / `onMenuOpen` / `onMenuClose` - control whether the menu is open
- `inputValue` / `onInputChange` - control the value of the search input (changing this will update the available options)

If you don't provide these props, you can set the initial value of the state they control:

- `defaultValue` - set the initial value of the control
- `defaultMenuIsOpen` - set the initial open value of the menu
- `defaultInputValue` - set the initial value of the search input

## Methods

React-select exposes two public methods:

- `focus()` - focus the control programatically
- `blur()` - blur the control programatically

## Customisation

Check the docs for more information on:

- [Customising the styles](https://www.react-select.com/styles)
- [Using custom components](https://www.react-select.com/components)
- [Using the built-in animated components](https://www.react-select.com/home#animated-components)

**react-spring** is a spring-physics based animation library that should cover most of your UI related animation needs. It gives you tools flexible enough to confidently cast your ideas into moving interfaces.

This library represents a modern approach to animation. It is very much inspired by Christopher Chedeau's [animated](https://github.com/animatedjs/animated) and Cheng Lou's [react-motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion). It inherits animated's powerful interpolations and performance, as well as react-motion's ease of use. But while animated is mostly imperative and react-motion mostly declarative, react-spring bridges both. You will be surprised how easy static data is cast into motion with small, explicit utility functions that don't necessarily affect how you form your views.

### Installation

    npm install react-spring

### Documentation and Examples

## Why springs and not durations

The principle you will be working with is called a `spring`, it *does not have a defined curve or a set duration*. In that it differs greatly from the animation you are probably used to. We think of animation in terms of time and curves, but that in itself causes most of the struggle we face when trying to make elements on the screen move naturally, because nothing in the real world moves like that.

<p align="middle">
  <img height="250" src="https://i.imgur.com/7CCH51r.gif" />
</p>

We are so used to time-based animation that we believe that struggle is normal, dealing with arbitrary curves, easings, time waterfalls, not to mention getting this all in sync. As Andy Matuschak (ex Apple UI-Kit developer) [expressed it once](https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/566736015188963328): *Animation APIs parameterized by duration and curve are fundamentally opposed to continuous, fluid interactivity*.

Springs change that, animation becomes easy and approachable, everything you do looks and feels natural by default. For a detailed explanation watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/1tavDv5hXpo?controls=1&amp;start=370).

# Redux DevTools Extension's helper

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension](https://badges.gitter.im/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension.svg)](https://gitter.im/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

## Usage

  Install:
  ```
  npm install --save redux-devtools-extension
  ```
  and use like that:
  ```js
  import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
  import { composeWithDevTools } from 'redux-devtools-extension';

  const store = createStore(reducer, composeWithDevTools(
    applyMiddleware(...middleware),
    // other store enhancers if any
  ));
  ```
  or if needed to apply [extensionâs options](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension/blob/master/docs/API/Arguments.md#windowdevtoolsextensionconfig):
  ```js
  import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
  import { composeWithDevTools } from 'redux-devtools-extension';

  const composeEnhancers = composeWithDevTools({
    // Specify here name, actionsBlacklist, actionsCreators and other options
  });
  const store = createStore(reducer, composeEnhancers(
    applyMiddleware(...middleware),
    // other store enhancers if any
  ));
  ```
  Thereâre just [few lines of code](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension/blob/master/npm-package/index.js). If you donât want to allow the extension in production, just use âredux-devtools-extension/developmentOnlyâ instead of âredux-devtools-extensionâ.

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - run-queue@1.0.3

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# run-queue

A promise based, dynamic priority queue runner, with concurrency limiting.

```js
const RunQueue = require('run-queue')

const queue = new RunQueue({
  maxConcurrency: 1
})

queue.add(1, example, [-1])
for (let ii = 0; ii < 5; ++ii) {
  queue.add(0, example, [ii])
}
const finished = []
queue.run().then(
  console.log(finished)
})

function example (num, next) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    finished.push(num)
    next()
  }, 5 - Math.abs(num))
}
```

would output

```
[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1 ]
```

If you bump concurrency to `2`, then you get:

```
[ 1, 0, 3, 2, 4, -1 ]
```

The concurrency means that they don't finish in order, because some take
longer than others.  Each priority level must finish entirely before the
next priority level is run.  See
[PRIORITIES](https://github.com/iarna/run-queue#priorities) below.  This is
even true if concurrency is set high enough that all of the regular queue
can execute at once, for instance, with `maxConcurrency: 10`:

```
[ 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1 ]
```

## API

### const queue = new RunQueue(options)

Create a new queue. Options may contain:

* maxConcurrency - (Default: `1`) The maximum number of jobs to execute at once.
* Promise - (Default: global.Promise) The promise implementation to use.

### queue.add (prio, fn, args)

Add a new job to the end of the queue at priority `prio` that will run `fn`
with `args`. If `fn` is async then it should return a Promise.

### queue.run ()

Start running the job queue.  Returns a Promise that resolves when either
all the jobs are complete or a job ends in error (throws or returns a
rejected promise). If a job ended in error then this Promise will be rejected
with that error and no further queue running will be done.

## PRIORITIES

Priorities are any integer value >= 0.

Lowest is executed first.

Priorities essentially represent distinct job queues.  All jobs in a queue
must complete before the next highest priority job queue is executed.

This means that if you have two queues, `0` and `1` then ALL jobs in `0`
must complete before ANY execute in `1`.  If you add new `0` level jobs
while `1` level jobs are running then it will switch back processing the `0`
queue and won't execute any more `1` jobs till all of the new `0` jobs
complete.

 - sane@4.1.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/amasad/sane.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/amasad/sane)

sane
----

I've been driven to insanity by node filesystem watcher wrappers.
Sane aims to be fast, small, and reliable file system watcher. It does that by:

* By default stays away from fs polling because it's very slow and cpu intensive
* Uses `fs.watch` by default and sensibly works around the various issues
* Maintains a consistent API across different platforms
* Where `fs.watch` is not reliable you have the choice of using the following alternatives:
  * [the facebook watchman library](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/)
  * [the watchexec library](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)
  * polling

## Install

```
$ npm install sane
```

## How to choose a mode

Don't worry too much about choosing the correct mode upfront because sane
maintains the same API across all modes and will be easy to switch.

* If you're only supporting Linux and OS X, `watchman` would be the most reliable mode
* If you're using node > v0.10.0 use the default mode
* If you're running OS X and you're watching a lot of directories and you're running into https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/5463, use `watchman`
* If you're in an environment where native file system events aren't available (like Vagrant), you should use polling
* Otherwise, the default mode should work well for you

## API

### sane(dir, options)

Watches a directory and all its descendant directories for changes, deletions, and additions on files and directories.

```js
var watcher = sane('path/to/dir', {glob: ['**/*.js', '**/*.css']});
watcher.on('ready', function () { console.log('ready') });
watcher.on('change', function (filepath, root, stat) { console.log('file changed', filepath); });
watcher.on('add', function (filepath, root, stat) { console.log('file added', filepath); });
watcher.on('delete', function (filepath, root) { console.log('file deleted', filepath); });
// close
watcher.close();
```

options:

* `glob`: a single string glob pattern or an array of them.
* `poll`: puts the watcher in polling mode. Under the hood that means `fs.watchFile`.
* `watchman`: makes the watcher use [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/).
* `watchmanPath`: sets a custom path for `watchman` binary.
* `watchexec`: makes the watcher use [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec).
* `dot`: enables watching files/directories that start with a dot.
* `ignored`: a glob, regex, function, or array of any combination.

For the glob pattern documentation, see [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch).
If you choose to use `watchman` you'll have to [install watchman yourself](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html)).
If you choose to use `watchexec` you'll have to [install watchexec yourself](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)).
For the ignored options, see [anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch).

### sane.NodeWatcher(dir, options)

The default watcher class. Uses `fs.watch` under the hood, and takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.

### sane.WatchmanWatcher(dir, options)

The watchman watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.

### sane.Watchexec(dir, options)

The watchexec watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.

### sane.PollWatcher(dir, options)

The polling watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)` with the addition of:

* interval: indicates how often the files should be polled. (passed to fs.watchFile)

### sane.{Node|Watchman|Watchexec|Poll}Watcher#close

Stops watching.

### sane.{Node|Watchman|Watchexec|Poll}Watcher events

Emits the following events:

All events are passed the file/dir path relative to the root directory
* `ready` when the program is ready to detect events in the directory
* `change` when a file changes
* `add` when a file or directory has been added
* `delete` when a file or directory has been deleted

## CLI

This module includes a simple command line interface, which you can install with `npm install sane -g`.

```
Usage: sane <command> [...directory] [--glob=<filePattern>] [--poll] [--watchman] [--watchman-path=<watchmanBinaryPath>] [--dot] [--wait=<seconds>]

OPTIONS:
    --glob=<filePattern>
      A single string glob pattern or an array of them.

    --ignored=<filePattern>
      A glob, regex, function, or array of any combination.

    --poll, -p
      Use polling mode.

    --watchman, -w
      Use watchman (if available).

    --watchman-path=<watchmanBinaryPath>
      Sets a custom path for watchman binary (if using this mode).

    --dot, -d
      Enables watching files/directories that start with a dot.

    --wait=<seconds>
      Duration, in seconds, that watching will be disabled
      after running <command>. Setting this option will
      throttle calls to <command> for the specified duration.
    --quiet, -q
      Disables sane's console output

    --changes-only, -o
      Runs <command> only when a change occur. Skips running <command> at startup
```

It will watch the given `directory` and run the given <command> every time a file changes.

### CLI example usage
- `sane 'echo "A command ran"'`
- `sane 'echo "A command ran"' --glob='**/*.css'`
- `sane 'echo "A command ran"' site/assets/css --glob='**/*.css'`
- `sane 'echo "A command ran"' --glob='**/*.css' --ignored='**/ignore.css'`
- `sane 'echo "A command ran"' --wait=3`
- `sane 'echo "A command ran"' -p`

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

> â ï¸ **CANARY:** This is the `canary` branch of `styled-components`. It is published under the
> `@beta` tag on npm and contains new features and changes for the next major version.

Utilising [tagged template literals](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#tagged-template-literals) (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the [power of CSS](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/api#supported-css), `styled-components` allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles â using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier!

```jsx
const Button = styled.button`
  color: grey;
`;
```

Alternatively, you may use [style objects](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#style-objects). This allows for easy porting of CSS from inline styles, while still supporting the more advanced styled-components capabilities like component selectors and media queries.

```jsx
const Button = styled.button({
  color: 'grey',
});
```

Equivalent to:

```jsx
const Button = styled.button`
  color: grey;
`;
```

`styled-components` is compatible with both React (for web) and React Native â meaning it's the perfect choice even for truly universal apps! See the [documentation about React Native](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics#react-native) for more information.

_Supported by [Front End Center](https://frontend.center). Thank you for making this possible!_

## Upgrading from v4

1. `npm install styled-components@beta react@^16.8 react-dom@^16.8 react-is@^16.8`
1. ??
1. Profit!

> Note that integrations like `jest-styled-components` that make use of internals will need to be updated to work with v5 and likely will not work properly during the alpha/beta period.

## [Docs](https://www.styled-components.com/docs)

**See the documentation at [styled-components.com/docs](https://www.styled-components.com/docs)** for more information about using `styled-components`!

Quicklinks to some of the most-visited pages:

- [**Getting started**](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics)
- [API Reference](https://styled-components.com/docs/api)
- [Theming](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#theming)
- [Server-side rendering](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#server-side-rendering)
- [Tagged Template Literals explained](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#tagged-template-literals)

## Example

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```JSX
import React from 'react';

import styled from 'styled-components';

// Create a <Title> react component that renders an <h1> which is
// centered, palevioletred and sized at 1.5em
const Title = styled.h1`
  font-size: 1.5em;
  text-align: center;
  color: palevioletred;
`;

// Create a <Wrapper> react component that renders a <section> with
// some padding and a papayawhip background
const Wrapper = styled.section`
  padding: 4em;
  background: papayawhip;
`;

// Use them like any other React component â except they're styled!
<Wrapper>
  <Title>Hello World, this is my first styled component!</Title>
</Wrapper>
```

This is what you'll see in your browser:

    <img alt="Screenshot of the above code ran in a browser" src="http://i.imgur.com/wUJpcjY.jpg" />
  </a>
</div>

## Babel Macro

If you're using tooling that has babel-plugin-macros set up, you can switch to the `styled-components/macro` import path instead to gain the effects of the babel plugin without further setup.

```js
import styled from 'styled-components/macro';

// A static className will be generated for Title (important for SSR)
const Title = styled.h1`
  font-size: 1.5em;
  text-align: center;
  color: palevioletred;
`;
```

If you wish to provide configuration options to the babel plugin similar to how you would in a `.babelrc`, [see this guide](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros/blob/master/other/docs/author.md#config-experimental). The config name is `"styledComponents"`.

## Built with `styled-components`

A lot of hard work goes into community libraries, projects, and guides. A lot of them make it easier to get started or help you with your next project! Thereâs also a whole lot of interesting apps and sites that people have built using styled-components.

Make sure to head over to [awesome-styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/awesome-styled-components) to see them all! And please contribute and add your own work to the list so others can find it.

const Button = styled.button`
  color: grey;
`;
```

Alternatively, you may use [style objects](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#style-objects). This allows for easy porting of CSS from inline styles, while still supporting the more advanced styled-components capabilities like component selectors and media queries.

```jsx
const Button = styled.button({
  color: 'grey',
});
```

Equivalent to:

```jsx
const Button = styled.button`
  color: grey;
`;
```

`styled-components` is compatible with both React (for web) and React Native â meaning it's the perfect choice even for truly universal apps! See the [documentation about React Native](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics#react-native) for more information.

_Supported by [Front End Center](https://frontend.center). Thank you for making this possible!_

## [Docs](https://www.styled-components.com/docs)

**See the documentation at [styled-components.com/docs](https://www.styled-components.com/docs)** for more information about using `styled-components`!

Quicklinks to some of the most-visited pages:

- [**Getting started**](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics)
- [API Reference](https://styled-components.com/docs/api)
- [Theming](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#theming)

- [Tagged Template Literals explained](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#tagged-template-literals)

## Example

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```JSX
import React from 'react';

import styled from 'styled-components';

// Create a <Title> react component that renders an <h1> which is
// centered, palevioletred and sized at 1.5em
const Title = styled.h1`
  font-size: 1.5em;
  text-align: center;
  color: palevioletred;
`;

// Create a <Wrapper> react component that renders a <section> with
// some padding and a papayawhip background
const Wrapper = styled.section`
  padding: 4em;
  background: papayawhip;
`;

// Use them like any other React component â except they're styled!
<Wrapper>
  <Title>Hello World, this is my first styled component!</Title>
</Wrapper>
```

This is what you'll see in your browser:

<div align="center">
  <a href="https://styled-components.com">
    <img alt="Screenshot of the above code ran in a browser" src="http://i.imgur.com/wUJpcjY.jpg" />
  </a>
</div>

## Babel Macro

If you're using tooling that has babel-plugin-macros set up, you can switch to the `styled-components/macro` import path instead to gain the effects of the babel plugin without further setup.

```js
import styled from 'styled-components/macro';

// A static className will be generated for Title (important for SSR)
const Title = styled.h1`
  font-size: 1.5em;
  text-align: center;
  color: palevioletred;
`;
```

If you wish to provide configuration options to the babel plugin similar to how you would in a `.babelrc`, [see this guide](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros/blob/master/other/docs/author.md#config-experimental). The config name is `"styledComponents"`.

## Built with `styled-components`

A lot of hard work goes into community libraries, projects, and guides. A lot of them make it easier to get started or help you with your next project! Thereâs also a whole lot of interesting apps and sites that people have built using styled-components.

Make sure to head over to [awesome-styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/awesome-styled-components) to see them all! And please contribute and add your own work to the list so others can find it.

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# URI.js

URI.js is an [RFC 3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) compliant, scheme extendable URI parsing/validating/resolving library for all JavaScript environments (browsers, Node.js, etc).
It is also compliant with the IRI ([RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt)), IDNA ([RFC 5890](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5890.txt)), IPv6 Address ([RFC 5952](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5952.txt)), IPv6 Zone Identifier ([RFC 6874](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6874.txt)) specifications.

URI.js has an extensive test suite, and works in all (Node.js, web) environments. It weighs in at 6.2kb (gzipped, 16kb deflated).

## API

### Parsing

	URI.parse("uri://user:pass@example.com:123/one/two.three?q1=a1&q2=a2#body");
	//returns:
	//{
	//  scheme : "uri",
	//  userinfo : "user:pass",
	//  host : "example.com",
	//  port : 123,
	//  path : "/one/two.three",
	//  query : "q1=a1&q2=a2",
	//  fragment : "body"
	//}

### Serializing

	URI.serialize({scheme : "http", host : "example.com", fragment : "footer"}) === "http://example.com/#footer"

### Resolving

	URI.resolve("uri://a/b/c/d?q", "../../g") === "uri://a/g"

### Normalizing

	URI.normalize("HTTP://ABC.com:80/%7Esmith/home.html") === "http://abc.com/~smith/home.html"

### Comparison

	URI.equal("example://a/b/c/%7Bfoo%7D", "eXAMPLE://a/./b/../b/%63/%7bfoo%7d") === true

### IP Support

	//IPv4 normalization
	URI.normalize("//192.068.001.000") === "//192.68.1.0"

	//IPv6 normalization
	URI.normalize("//[2001:0:0DB8::0:0001]") === "//[2001:0:db8::1]"

	//IPv6 zone identifier support
	URI.parse("//[2001:db8::7%25en1]");
	//returns:
	//{
	//  host : "2001:db8::7%en1"
	//}

### IRI Support

	//convert IRI to URI
	URI.serialize(URI.parse("http://examplÃ©.org/rosÃ©")) === "http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9"
	//convert URI to IRI
	URI.serialize(URI.parse("http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9"), {iri:true}) === "http://examplÃ©.org/rosÃ©"

### Options

All of the above functions can accept an additional options argument that is an object that can contain one or more of the following properties:

*	`scheme` (string)

	Indicates the scheme that the URI should be treated as, overriding the URI's normal scheme parsing behavior.

*	`reference` (string)

	If set to `"suffix"`, it indicates that the URI is in the suffix format, and the validator will use the option's `scheme` property to determine the URI's scheme.

*	`tolerant` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the parser will relax URI resolving rules.

*	`absolutePath` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the serializer will not resolve a relative `path` component.

*	`iri` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the serializer will unescape non-ASCII characters as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).

*	`unicodeSupport` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the parser will unescape non-ASCII characters in the parsed output as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).

*	`domainHost` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the library will treat the `host` component as a domain name, and convert IDNs (International Domain Names) as per [RFC 5891](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5891.txt).

## Scheme Extendable

URI.js supports inserting custom [scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme) dependent processing rules. Currently, URI.js has built in support for the following schemes:

*	http \[[RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)\]
*	https \[[RFC 2818](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt)\]
*	mailto \[[RFC 6068](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6068.txt)\]
*	urn \[[RFC 2141](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt)\]
*	urn:uuid \[[RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)\]

### HTTP Support

	URI.equal("HTTP://ABC.COM:80", "http://abc.com/") === true

### Mailto Support

	URI.parse("mailto:alpha@example.com,bravo@example.com?subject=SUBSCRIBE&body=Sign%20me%20up!");
	//returns:
	//{
	//	scheme : "mailto",
	//	to : ["alpha@example.com", "bravo@example.com"],
	//	subject : "SUBSCRIBE",
	//	body : "Sign me up!"
	//}

	URI.serialize({
		scheme : "mailto",
		to : ["alpha@example.com"],
		subject : "REMOVE",
		body : "Please remove me",
		headers : {
			cc : "charlie@example.com"
		}
	}) === "mailto:alpha@example.com?cc=charlie@example.com&subject=REMOVE&body=Please%20remove%20me"

### URN Support

	URI.parse("urn:example:foo");
	//returns:
	//{
	//	scheme : "urn",
	//	nid : "example",
	//	nss : "foo",
	//}

#### URN UUID Support

	URI.parse("urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6");
	//returns:
	//{
	//	scheme : "urn",
	//	nid : "example",
	//	uuid : "f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6",
	//}

## Usage

To load in a browser, use the following tag:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="uri-js/dist/es5/uri.all.min.js"></script>

To load in a CommonJS (Node.js) environment, first install with npm by running on the command line:

	npm install uri-js

Then, in your code, load it using:

	const URI = require("uri-js");

If you are writing your code in ES6+ (ESNEXT) or TypeScript, you would load it using:

	import * as URI from "uri-js";

Or you can load just what you need using named exports:

	import { parse, serialize, resolve, resolveComponents, normalize, equal, removeDotSegments, pctEncChar, pctDecChars, escapeComponent, unescapeComponent } from "uri-js";

## Breaking changes

### Breaking changes from 3.x

URN parsing has been completely changed to better align with the specification. Scheme is now always `urn`, but has two new properties: `nid` which contains the Namspace Identifier, and `nss` which contains the Namespace Specific String. The `nss` property will be removed by higher order scheme handlers, such as the UUID URN scheme handler.

The UUID of a URN can now be found in the `uuid` property.

### Breaking changes from 2.x

URI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.

### Breaking changes from 1.x

The `errors` array on parsed components is now an `error` string.

      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

This module is mostly used as an internal part of [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom). However, you can use it independently with some care. That isn't very well-documented yet, but hopefully the below sample can give you an idea.

## Basic usage

```js
const { XMLSerializer } = require("w3c-xmlserializer");
const { JSDOM } = require("jsdom");

const { document } = new JSDOM().window;
const XMLSerializer = XMLSerializer.interface;
const serializer = new XMLSerializer();
const doc = document.createElement("akomaNtoso");

console.log(serializer.serializeToString(doc));
// => '<akomantoso xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></akomantoso>'
```

      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
